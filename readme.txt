Built in Python3
Required Python packages: numpy, pandas, sklearn, time, warnings

File names, column names and all data removed for privacy reasons

This is a simple machine learning tool built in python with scikit-learn
Designed with medical data, numerical only
Designed for the purpose of a Bioinformatics Masters dissertation

The usage depends on file and column header names (comments help to clarify)

Easily customisable, replace some of the code to change the classifier
Can also remove the discretiser and it will still work just as well (less efficient)

If you somehow find this and need help adjusting to your data feel free to get in touch
